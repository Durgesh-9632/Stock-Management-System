# Stock-Management-System

The Stock Management System project utilizing Python with Tkinter for the GUI and MySQL for database management provides a streamlined interface for inventory control. This application is designed to handle basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on product data stored in a MySQL database. The GUI interface, built using Tkinter, includes fields for entering product details such as name, quantity, and price. Users can add new products, update existing ones, delete products by name, and search for products by name to view their details. Error handling is implemented to manage database operations securely, ensuring that any issues with queries or connections are appropriately displayed to the user through the GUI's output text area.
